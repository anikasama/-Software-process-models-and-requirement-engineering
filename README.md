Savana – SDLC Case Study
A Software Engineering case study analyzing the development of a recommendation platform (Savana) using different Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models.

 About the Project
Savana is a conceptual web-based recommendation platform designed mainly for girls.
The system provides suggestions related to fashion, beauty, lifestyle and study needs based on user activity.
This project compares three SDLC models:
•	Waterfall Model
•	Incremental Model
•	Spiral Model
The comparison is done based on:
•	Functional & Non-Functional Requirements
•	Risk and Change Management
•	Time and Cost Constraints

 Objectives
•	Understand the Requirements Engineering process
•	Analyze how requirements evolve in real systems
•	Compare SDLC models in a practical scenario
•	Demonstrate version control using GitHub

 Features of Savana (System Studied)
•	User registration and login
•	Product browsing and search
•	Personalized recommendations
•	Wishlist and cart
•	Secure payment system
•	Seller product management
•	Admin monitoring and analytics
 Requirements Engineering
Two versions of the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) are included:
•	Initial Requirements → basic system understanding
•	Revised Requirements → updated after analysis and feedback
This shows how software requirements change during development.

 Requirements Validation
Requirements were validated using:
•	Requirement reviews
•	Mockups/prototypes
•	Test cases
•	Feedback discussions
Challenges
•	Changing user expectations
•	Predicting recommendation behavior
•	Security vs usability balance
•	Payment safety handling

 Branching and Merging Strategy
This project uses a simple Git workflow.
Branches
main
•	Final stable project
•	Contains final report and revised SRS
requirements-update
•	Used to modify and improve the initial requirements
Process
1.	Initial requirements uploaded to main
2.	New branch requirements-update created
3.	Requirements improved
4.	Pull request created
5.	Merged into main
This demonstrates how real development teams handle requirement changes.

 SDLC Model Comparison
Model	Suitability
Waterfall	Not suitable (requirements frequently change)
Incremental	Suitable (features added gradually)
Spiral	Highly suitable (risk handling and security)
